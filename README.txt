Python-Mistakes INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================================================================

1. Please make sure you have pymongo, virtualenv, and weka installed 

2. Use DATACOLLECT.py to collect data for yes and no entries. 

3. Upload the data into the arff file by using WRITER6.py. This will also check for duplicate entries AND will modify the keys. 

4. Run the resulting arff file in weka.

Enjoy :)
