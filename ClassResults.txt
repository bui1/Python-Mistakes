#Entries of what I think about certain classifiers and how they are doing. I think we'll have to use filtered classifier for all anyways. 


Zero R is dumb
~Bagging is not the best but the accuracy for yes and no is about equal
~VotedPerceptron is not very accurate (about 67%) but much better at clssifying for no's.
			nvm, it's terrible when combined with others
~Random Commitee under meta is also not bad
~Random SupSpace works too
~J48 remains the best






*Used Vote under meta and a combination of Random Forest and REP Tree:
Cross Validation: 77.39%
50-50 Percetage Split: 70.93%
Supplied Test for 12: 66.67%

*Used PART under rules:
Cross Validation: 75.07%
50-50 Percetage Split: 74.42%
Supplied Test for 12: 75%
(Slightly better at classifying for no's)

(Add another Bagging with RandomTree for even better results)
(Add also add a Bagging with PART section)
