#Entries of what I think about certain classifiers and how they are doing. I think we'll have to use filtered classifier for all anyways. 


Zero R is dumb
~Bagging is awesome when used under voting! (Not suggested individually) 
~VotedPerceptron is not very accurate (about 67%) but much better at clssifying for no's.
			nvm, it's terrible when combined with others
~Random Commitee under meta is also not bad
~Random SupSpace works too
~J48 remains the best
~AdaBoost might work and you can add one more classifier to it
~SMO is good


~LogisticR under functions: 71.13% 
~SGD under functions: 74.80% 
~SMO under functions: 75.07% 
~AttributeSelectedClassifier under meta: 76.12% (and you can add another classifier to it)
~Bagging under meta: 77.69% (and you can add another classifier to it)
~LogicBoost under meta: 77.95% (nvm DONT't use it)
~RandomSubSpace under meta: 76.38% (72.63 in 50-50 percent split. Better for no's!)
~Decision Table under rules: 75.59% (JRip about the same)
~PART under rules: 76.64%


~NaiveBaysMultinomialText: 81.65%
     		(most bayes are quite good other than NaiveBayes and NaiveBayesUpdateable)
~SGD under functions: 81.84%
