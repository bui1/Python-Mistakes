#Entries of what I think about certain classifiers and how they are doing. I think we'll have to use filtered classifier for all anyways. 


Zero R is dumb
~Bagging is not the best but the accuracy for yes and no is about equal
~VotedPerceptron is not very accurate (about 67%) but much better at clssifying for no's.
			nvm, it's terrible when combined with others
~Random Commitee under meta is also not bad
~Random SupSpace works too
~J48 remains the best
~AdaBoost might work and you can add one more classifier to it


~LogisticR under functions: 71.13% 
~SGD under functions: 74.80% 
~SMO under functions: 75.07% 
~AttributeSelectedClassifier under meta: 76.12% (and you can add another classifier to it)
~Bagging under meta: 77.69% (and you can add another classifier to it)
~LogicBoost under meta: 77.95%
